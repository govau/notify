# Accepting callbacks

A callback lets you receive message delivery updates and/or inbound SMS from Notify to a URL you choose.

<span />

On a server you control, you should set up an endpoint that can accept POST
requests. Notify will POST messages in a JSON format to the endpoint you specify.

To ensure that callbacks are coming from Notify and not some other malicious
source, you will need to create a "bearer token" when setting up the callback
URL. A bearer token should be a long randomised piece of text that an attacker
wouldn’t be able to impersonate.

**When creating a bearer token, you should:**

- keep your bearer token secure
- change it if you have any reason to think it might no longer be trusted
- make sure that callbacks you receive from Notify contain your bearer token in the `Authorization` header
- use a hashed value so that Notify doesn’t hold the true token

## Message delivery updates

When you send an email or text message through Notify, we can send a receipt to your callback URL to tell you if we were able to deliver it or not.

The JSON message that Notify sends has this format:

```json inline nonumbers
{
	"id": "UUID",
	"reference": "12345678",
	"to": "person@example.com",
	"status": "delivered",
	"notification_type": "email",
	"created_at": "2017-05-14T12:15:30.000000Z",
	"completed_at": "2017-05-14T12:15:30.000000Z",
	"sent_at": "2017-05-14T12:15:30.000000Z"
}
```

<SimplePanel label={<H3>Fields</H3>}>
<Parameters>
  <Parameter name="id" kind="UUID">Notify’s ID for this notification. You can use this to correlate with the ID that is returned when you send a message.</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="reference" optional kind="string">The reference potentially sent with your API request</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="to" kind="string">

The email address or phone number of the recipient.

If `notification_type` is `email`, this is the recipient’s email address.

If `notification_type` is `sms`, this is the recipient’s E.164 formatted phone number.

  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="status" kind="string">

The status of the notification.

Possible values:

- `sending`
- `delivered`
- `permanent-failure`
- `temporary-failure`
- `technical-failure`

</Parameter>
<Parameter name="notification_type" kind="string">

The notification type, either `email` or `sms`

</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="created_at" kind="ISO-8601 string">The time in UTC that the service sent the request</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="completed_at" kind="ISO-8601 string">The last time in UTC that the status was updated</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="sent_at" optional kind="ISO-8601 string">The time in UTC that the notification was sent</Parameter>
</Parameters>
</SimplePanel>

A simple callback handler might look like this:

## Inbound SMS messages

If your service receives text messages in Notify, we can forward them to your callback URL as soon as they arrive.

The JSON message that Notify sends has this format:

```json inline nonumbers
{
	"id": "UUID",
	"source_number": "+61412987654",
	"destination_number": "+61412345678",
	"message": "Hello Notify!",
	"date_received": "2017-05-14T12:15:30.000000Z"
}
```

<SimplePanel label={<H3>Fields</H3>}>
<Parameters>
  <Parameter name="id" kind="UUID">Notify’s ID for the message</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="source_number" kind="string">The E.164 formatted phone number the message was sent from (the original recipient’s number)</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="destination_number" kind="string">The E.164 formatted phone number the message was sent to (your service’s number)</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="message" kind="string">The content of the received message</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="date_received" kind="ISO-8601 string">The UTC datetime that the message was received by Notify</Parameter>
</Parameters>
</SimplePanel>

A simple callback handler might look like this:

If you don't need to respond to SMS messages in real-time, there is also a get_received_texts API
to retrieve all received messages for up to 7 days:
