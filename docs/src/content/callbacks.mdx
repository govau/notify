# Accepting callbacks

A callback lets you receive message delivery updates and/or inbound SMS from Notify to a URL you choose.

<span />

On a server you control, you should set up an endpoint that can accept POST
requests. Notify will POST messages in a JSON format to the endpoint you specify.

To ensure that callbacks are coming from Notify and not some other malicious
source, you will need to create a "bearer token" when setting up the callback
URL. A bearer token should be a long randomised piece of text that an attacker
wouldn't be able to impersonate.

**When creating a bearer token, you should:**

- keep your bearer token secure
- change it if you have any reason to think it might no longer be trusted
- make sure that callbacks you recieve from Notify contain your bearer token as an authorisation header
- use a hashed value so that Notify doesn't hold the true token

## Message delivery updates

When you send an email or text message through Notify, we can send a receipt to your callback URL to tell you if we were able to deliver it or not.

The JSON message that Notify sends has this format:

```json inline nonumbers
{
	"id": "UUID",
	"reference": "12345678",
	"to": "person@example.com",
	"status": "delivered",
	"notification_type": "email",
	"created_at": "2017-05-14T12:15:30.000000Z",
	"completed_at": "2017-05-14T12:15:30.000000Z",
	"sent_at": "2017-05-14T12:15:30.000000Z"
}
```

## Inbound SMS messages

If your service receives text messages in Notify, we can forward them to your callback URL as soon as they arrive.

The JSON message that Notify sends has this format:

```json inline nonumbers
{
	"id": "UUID",
	"source_number": "61412987654",
	"destination_number": "0412345678",
	"message": "Hello Notify!",
	"date_received": "2017-05-14T12:15:30.000000Z"
}
```
